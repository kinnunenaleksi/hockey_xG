## Overview 

hockey_xG is a personal project to build a naive model using logistic regression to estimate a xG value depending on the cordinates of the shot. 
The data is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martinellis/nhl-game-data) and the original inspiration from [Friends of Tracking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpjLyFyLlXs).
